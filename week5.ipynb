    "The practical note for this week introduces you to neural network mining in Python, particularly using multilayer perceptron classifier. Neural networks are a class of predictive models that mimic the structure of human brain. It consists of layers of neurons, each consuming outputs from the previous layers as inputs. Neural network is the most complex model out of everything that we have used so far.\n",

    "Last week, we learned how to perform data mining with decision trees in Python. For this week, we will again reuse the code for data preprocessing. Just as regression models, neural networks are sensitive to skewed data, thus we also perform standarization on it:"
