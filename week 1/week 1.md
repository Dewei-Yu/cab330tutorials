# Week 1: Installing and Understanding Python's Data Mining Libraries

## 1. Why Python?
A number of reason why learning Python for data mining/machine learning purpose is great:
#### 1.1. Script-based language.
Allow us to wrangle data and prototype really quickly.

#### 1.2. Open-source
No ties to any propertiary/corporate technologies

#### 1.3. Fast and wide support for almost anything that you want to do

Vast range of libraries for almost every data mining task.

* **pandas** for data wrangling and preprocessing ([link](http://pandas.pydata.org/))
* **scikit-learn** for supervised and unsupervised learning ([link](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/))
* **numpy** for matrix manipulation ([link](http://www.numpy.org/))
* **seaborn** and **matplotlib** for visualization ([link](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)) ([link2](https://matplotlib.org/))
* **ipython** for interactive prototyping ([link](https://ipython.org/))


#### 1.4. Production ready
Models and pipelines built with Python are very suitable to deployment in production systems.

## 2. Installing Python and its data mining libraries

We will be using Python 3.6.1 and its libraries in this course

#### 2.1. Download and install Python
Google "Python 3" and download it from the official website.

#### 2.1.1. (For Windows) Set the variable environment

#### 2.2. Install required packages
```bash
pip install ipython pandas sklearn matplotlib numpy seaborn nltk
```
